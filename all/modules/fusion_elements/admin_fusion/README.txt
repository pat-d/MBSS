Admin Fusion
================

The Admin Fusion feature enables a few modules that will be helpful in administering your site:
  - Absolute Messages (http://drupal.org/project/absolute_messages) - improved display of Drupal System messages. Messages display at the top of the page and can be dismissed, or a timer can be set to automatically hide messages after a certain time.
  - Devel and Devel Generate (http://drupal.org/project/devel) - Can be used to troubleshoot bugs in your site and to create sample content for testing purposes.  This module hould be disabled before the site goes "live."
  - Backup & Migrate (http://drupal.org/project/backup_migrate) - Useful tool for easily backing up your site's database or moving a database from a testing to a live server.
Additional information about these modules and their configuration can be found on the respective project pages on drupal.org.
